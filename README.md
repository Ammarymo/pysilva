# Problem Solving
Python is a fragile language when comparing it to other languages such as C, C++, Jave ...etc. But as a Biotechnology specialist, I don't care. I'd rather ruin my CPU than learn something like C.

### Why do I solve problems?
In order to be familiar with programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and data science.

### What will you get from this repo?
Absolutely nothing!
